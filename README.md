# Hyperparamter-Turning
Value of K for KNN vs.  Cross-Validated Accuracy

## Author
Jason Carpenter

## Overview
This project demonstrates hyperparameter tuning using the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`. The goal is to determine the optimal value of `k` for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using cross-validation and GridSearchCV.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is loaded from `sklearn.datasets`.

## Results
- The optimal value of `k` is determined and visualized through the plots.
- GridSearchCV confirms `k=13` as the optimal parameter.
